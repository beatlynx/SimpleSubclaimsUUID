[SimpleSubclaimsUUID v0.1.0]

Semantic Versioning: vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

MAJOR: Backwards incompatible API changes

MINOR: Backwards-compatible functionality

PATCH: Backwards-compatible bug fixes

This plugin allows faction members to create private chests, a.k.a. Subclaims, within their factions.

In a player's own faction's territory, placing a sign with "[Subclaim]" on the first line and the usernames of the players they wish to grant access to the chest to on the remaining lines blocks other factions members from opening or destroying that chest, with the exception of faction officers and the faction leader.

SimpleSubclaims was designed for and created using Bukkit/Spigot 1.8 and FactionsUUID. It most likely will NOT work with MassiveCraft's most recent release of Factions.

You can find FactionsUUID on Spigot here: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/factionsuuid.1035/

If you choose to use this plugin for commercial purposes, please try to give credit where it is due somewhere, and also support the author of FactionsUUID by purchasing the plugin.

A note to drtshock: I am not making any money off of using your API to make this plugin, I was asked to make this plugin by a friend for his server which uses FactionsUUID. I hope you understand. I respect your work and thank you for doing what you do.
