This plugin allows faction members to create private chests, a.k.a. Subclaims, within their factions. It requires drtshock's FactionsUUID, which can be found here on Spigot: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/factionsuuid.1035/

In a player's own faction's territory, placing a sign with "[Subclaim]" on the first line and the usernames of the players they wish to grant access to the chest to on the remaining lines blocks other factions members from opening or destroying that chest, with the exception of faction officers and the faction leader.

SimpleSubclaims was designed for and created using FactionsUUID's API. It most likely will NOT work with MassiveCraft's most recent release of Factions.
